Best effort project to overcome the fact that AKAI doesn't seem to be interested in fixing Segmentation faults in their [MPKmini Editor](https://www.akaipro.com/mpk-mini-mkii).

It currently fixes my own itches but I gladly accept feedback!

## Install

To install via [PyPi](https://pypi.org/):

```

```

To install from source you can use:

- `python3 setup.py install`, or
- `make install` which will run a `pipenv` including linting, tests, etc.

## Usage

`akai_mpkmini_mkii_ctrl` supports a set of commands to push or pull presets to and from the device. All commands have a common set of options:

```
-p, --preset NUM     Target preset slot (0 = RAM, 1-4 = Stored preset)
-m, --midi-port NUM  MIDI port (0 = Omni, > 0 = Specific MIDI port)
-v, --verbose        Verbose output
--help               Show this message and exit.
```

### Commands

`print-preset`: Print preset on device in human readable format. In this example it will print the preset stored in slot 1 on the device.

```shell
python3 -m akai_mpkmini_mkii_ctrl \
--preset 1 print-preset
```

`pull-preset`: Pull a binary from the device and write to file.

```shell
python3 -m akai_mpkmini_mkii_ctrl \
--preset 0 \
pull-preset \
--output-file ram-preset.mk2
```

`push-preset`: Push a local binary preset to the device. This also works with [factory binary presets](resources/factory-patches).

```shell
python3 -m akai_mpkmini_mkii_ctrl \
--preset 2 \
push-preset \
--input-file resources/factory-patches/preset1.mk2
```

`push-json-preset`: Push a local JSON preset ([Example](resources/json-presets/Logic-Base.json)) to the device. Notice that you are able to combine several input files for easier re-use. The configurations are applied in order, e.g., in this case [`Logic-Base.json`](resources/json-presets/Logic-Base.json) will be extended with the properties found in [`Logic-RetroSynth+Juno.json`](resources/json-presets/Logic-RetroSynth+Juno.json).

```shell
python3 -m akai_mpkmini_mkii_ctrl \
--preset 0 \
push-json-preset \
--input-file resources/json-presets/Logic-Base.json \
--input-file resources/json-presets/Logic-RetroSynth+Juno.json
```

## Development

You can prepare a `pipenv`-based development environment using:

```shell
make clean venv
```

You can also install the controller to your system using:

```shell
make install
```
